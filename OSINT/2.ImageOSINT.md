│
├── 1. What is Image OSINT?
│   │
│   ├── Definition
│   │   └── The practice of extracting actionable intelligence from images and videos in publicly available sources (social media, websites, forums, video platforms).
│   │
│   ├── Goals
│   │   ├── Identify people, places, events, or objects
│   │   ├── Geolocate an image or verify where/when it was taken
│   │   ├── Find image origins and duplicates (provenance)
│   │   └── Extract hidden or textual information (metadata, text, watermarks)
│
├── 2. High-level workflow (ordered)
│   │
│   ├── 1. Triage & preserve
│   │   └── Save original file(s), note source URL, capture context and timestamps (preserve chain of custody for reports).
│   │
│   ├── 2. Metadata & file analysis
│   │   └── Extract EXIF/IPTC/XMP, file hashes, container details.
│   │
│   ├── 3. Reverse image & provenance search
│   │   └── Find duplicates, earlier instances, or the original upload.
│   │
│   ├── 4. Visual content analysis
│   │   └── OCR, object detection, landmark recognition, logo detection, scene classification.
│   │
│   ├── 5. Geolocation & temporal inference
│   │   └── Use landmarks, signs, language, shadows, weather, vegetation, architectural cues, timestamps.
│   │
│   ├── 6. Social context correlation
│   │   └── Map images to user profiles, cross-reference with other posts, videos, or datasets.
│   │
│   └── 7. Reporting & verification
│       └── Build an evidence chain: claims, supporting artifacts, confidence levels, and remediation or action items.
│
├── 3. Data you can extract from an image
│   │
│   ├── File-level
│   │   ├── Filename, format (JPEG/PNG/WEBP), size, container info
│   │   ├── File hashes (MD5/SHA1/SHA256) for deduplication
│   │   └── Compression artifacts (quality, recompression)
│   │
│   ├── Metadata (EXIF/IPTC/XMP)
│   │   ├── Camera make/model, lens, focal length, exposure, timestamp
│   │   ├── GPS coordinates (if present) → direct geolocation
│   │   └── Software used (editors) and creation/modification timestamps
│   │
│   ├── Visual/textual content
│   │   ├── Text via OCR (signs, license plates, documents)
│   │   ├── Faces (presence / count) — note privacy/legal issues
│   │   ├── Logos, brands, clothing, objects
│   │   └── Architectural styles, road signs, vehicle types
│   │
│   └── Derived signals
│       ├── Perceptual hashes (pHash, aHash) for near-duplicate detection
│       ├── Error level analysis (ELA) hints at edits (careful; not definitive)
│       └── Lighting & shadow vectors for time-of-day estimation
│
├── 4. Key techniques (with what they reveal)
│   │
│   ├── Reverse Image Search
│   │   └── Tools: Google Images, TinEye, Yandex, Bing Visual Search → finds duplicates, earlier postings, and source pages.
│   │
│   ├── Metadata extraction
│   │   └── Tools: exiftool, online EXIF viewers → can reveal camera, GPS, software history.
│   │
│   ├── OCR (text extraction)
│   │   └── Tools: Tesseract, Google Vision, OCR.space → reads signs, documents, phone screens, receipts.
│   │
│   ├── Object & scene recognition
│   │   └── Tools/APIs: Google Vision, AWS Rekognition, Azure Vision, open models → identify objects, logos, landmarks, scenes.
│   │
│   ├── Facial analysis (identification is sensitive)
│   │   └── Face detection/embedding tools can cluster same-person images, but identification raises legal/ethical constraints.
│   │
│   ├── Geolocation by visual cues
│   │   └── Landmarks, vegetation, road markings, traffic signs, building styles, language on signs — combine to narrow location.
│   │
│   ├── Shadow & sun position analysis
│   │   └── Estimate time of day and hemisphere/latitude using shadow orientation and sun angle—gives temporal/geographic constraints.
│   │
│   ├── Image forensics
│   │   └── ELA, noise/frequency analysis, JPEG quantization tables, sensor noise patterns (PRNU) to detect manipulation or source camera.
│   │
│   ├── Metadata timeline correlation
│   │   └── Cross-check EXIF timestamps vs page timestamps, sitemap entries, and social post times for consistency.
│   │
│   └── Social graph linking
│       └── Trace image reposts across accounts, find account owners, and build attribution chains.
│
├── 5. Tools & categories (representative, not exhaustive)

│
├── 6. Practical multi-step example (high-level, authorized)
│   │
│   ├── Given an image from a public post:
│   │   ├── Save the original file + source URL + timestamp screenshot
│   │   ├── Extract EXIF → check GPS/camera info
│   │   ├── Reverse-search → find earlier instances or higher-resolution originals
│   │   ├── Run OCR → extract visible text, transliterate if foreign language

│   │   └── Assign confidence levels and prepare evidence with links/screenshots
│
├── 7. Limitations & pitfalls (what to trust carefully)
│   │
│   ├── EXIF can be stripped or forged — don’t assume authenticity
│   ├── Reverse-search misses uncrawled or newly uploaded images
│   ├── ELA and similar forensic outputs are suggestive, not definitive
│   ├── OCR may misread fonts, low-res text, or non-Latin scripts
│   ├── Visual similarity ≠ identity (look-alikes, stock images)
│   └── Facial ID has legal restrictions and high false-positive risk
│
├── 8. Legal & ethical considerations
│   │
│   ├── Privacy laws (GDPR, etc.) may restrict collection/processing of personal data
│   ├── Face recognition and identification often carry stricter rules — get explicit consent or legal authorization
│   ├── Preserve chain of custody for evidence and avoid publishing sensitive info
│   └── For corporate/Red Team work: always operate within written scope and company policy
│
├── 9. Defensive & hardening advice (for defenders)
│   │
│   ├── Strip EXIF/GPS from images before public upload (automate in web upload pipeline)
│   ├── Avoid embedding internal names, paths, or secrets in images/screenshots
│   ├── Watermark sensitive media (with caution — watermarks themselves can leak info)
│   ├── Rate-limit automated downloads and monitor requests to media endpoints, sitemaps, and image URLs
│   ├── Use low-resolution or cropped previews for public display; keep originals behind auth
│   └── Train staff on OPSEC for images (screenshots: blur/minimize PII)

Real Example — Image OSINT Walkthrough (file: beach_tower.jpg)
│
├── Summary of the case
│   │
│   ├── Source: Public post on company-internal Slack (authorized analysis)
│   ├── Filename: beach_tower.jpg
│   ├── Goal: Determine origin/time/location and whether image leaks sensitive info
│   └── Tools used: exiftool, Google/TinEye (reverse search), Tesseract OCR, imagehash, OpenCV, SunCalc, manual map comparison
│
├── 1. Preservation & initial notes
│   │
│   ├── Action: Save original file and a screenshot of the post (record URL, poster, timestamp).
│   ├── Rationale: Preserve chain-of-custody; avoid altering original file.
│   └── Files saved:
│       ├── beach_tower.jpg  (original)
│       └── slack_screenshot.png  (post metadata)
│
├── 2. File & metadata analysis (EXIF)
│   │
│   ├── Command:
│   │   └── exiftool beach_tower.jpg
│   │
│   ├── Example output (illustrative):
│   │   ├── File Name: beach_tower.jpg
│   │   ├── File Type: JPEG
│   │   ├── Camera: iPhone 11
│   │   ├── Date/Time Original: 2024:07:22 17:42:10
│   │   ├── GPS Latitude: 36.778259 N
│   │   ├── GPS Longitude: -121.914536 W
│   │   └── Software: Adobe Photoshop Express
│   │
│   ├── Interpretation:
│   │   ├── GPS present → direct geolocation candidate (high-confidence if EXIF not stripped/forged)
│   │   ├── Date/time present → suggests when photo was taken (may be camera-local timezone)
│   │   └── Editing software found → image may have been post-processed (reduce confidence slightly)
│   │
│   └── Confidence & caveat:
│       └── EXIF data can be stripped/edited — corroborate via reverse image search and visual cues.
│
├── 3. Hashing & deduplication (pHash)
│   │
│   ├── Command (Python / imagehash):
│   │   └── python -c "from PIL import Image; import imagehash; print(imagehash.phash(Image.open('beach_tower.jpg')))"
│   │
│   ├── Example output:
│   │   └── phash: 9f2a3b1c4d5e6f70
│   │
│   ├── Action:
│   │   └── Store pHash in DB to detect duplicates or near-duplicates on future collections.
│   │
│   └── Use:
│       └── Helps find copies with small edits (cropping/resize) via similarity matching.
│
├── 4. Reverse image search (provenance)
│   │
│   ├── Tools & action:
│   │   ├── Upload `beach_tower.jpg` to Google Images / TinEye / Yandex
│   │   └── Note earliest matches, exact-match vs resized variants
│   │
│   ├── Example findings (illustrative):
│   │   ├── Match A: Uploaded on Flickr 2024-07-22 by user "sunsets" (high-res original)
│   │   ├── Match B: Shared on travel blog (2024-07-23) with caption "Monterey lookout"
│   │   └── No older matches found
│   │
│   ├── Interpretation:
│   │   ├── Flickr upload timestamp corroborates EXIF date — increases confidence image is genuine
│   │   ├── Travel-blog caption suggests location region (Monterey → California coast)
│   │   └── Use link to original uploader to find more context (public posts, captions)
│   │
│   └── Caveat:
│       └── If a higher-res original predates EXIF timestamp → possible image reuse or tampering.
│
├── 5. OCR — extract visible text
│   │
│   ├── Command:
│   │   └── tesseract beach_tower.jpg out -l eng
│   │
│   ├── Example OCR output (out.txt):
│   │   └── "Monterey Coast Guard Tower — No entry. Lifeguard Station 3"
│   │
│   ├── Interpretation:
│   │   ├── Text explicitly names "Monterey" and "Lifeguard Station 3" → strong location signal
│   │   └── Use exact phrases for targeted web/search queries
│   │
│   └── Confidence:
│       └── OCR can misread; always manually verify text found in image.
│
├── 6. Visual clues & geolocation (manual + tools)
│   │
│   ├── Visual cues noted:
│   │   ├── Distinct red-and-white striped lifeguard tower
│   │   ├── Road signage style consistent with California
│   │   ├── Vegetation: coastal scrub, Monterey pines
│   │   └── Mountain silhouette matching nearby peninsula
│   │
│   ├── Actions:
│   │   ├── Search Google Maps / Street View for "Lifeguard Station 3 Monterey"
│   │   ├── Compare tower shape & background to Street View photos
│   │   └── Use SunCalc with EXIF datetime to check sun angle consistency
│   │
│   ├── Example result:
│   │   └── Visual match: exact tower found at Monterey State Beach access point; coordinates match EXIF ~ within 10m
│   │
│   └── Confidence:
│       └── EXIF GPS + reverse-search + visual match → HIGH confidence on location & time (assuming no tampering)
│
├── 7. Forensics (manipulation checks)
│   │
│   ├── Tools:
│   │   ├── FotoForensics (ELA)
│   │   ├── JPEGsnoop (quantization tables)
│   │   └── Check EXIF editing software tag (Photoshop Express found earlier)
│   │
│   ├── Findings (illustrative):
│   │   ├── ELA: slight inconsistency around sign edges — likely moderate-level contrast edit or compression
│   │   └── JPEG quantization consistent with mobile export then Photoshop re-save
│   │
│   ├── Interpretation:
│   │   └── Minor edits visible (colors/contrast). No evidence of object insertion/deletion at high confidence.
│   │
│   └── Caveat:
│       └── Forensics can suggest edits but rarely prove malicious intent — combine with provenance.
│
├── 8. Correlate social context (who posted)
│   │
│   ├── Action:
│   │   ├── Visit Flickr user profile found in reverse search
│   │   └── Check other uploads, bio, linked social accounts
│   │
│   ├── Example discovery:
│   │   ├── Flickr user "sunsets" is a travel blogger with multiple pictures of Monterey from July 2024
│   │   └── No signs of corporate or sensitive content linked to the uploader
│   │
│   ├── Risk check:
│   │   └── Image appears public and personal — not corporate internal content
│   │
│   └── Action item:
│       └── If original image had been corporate (internal docs/screenshots), notify ops immediately
│
├── 9. Produce findings & recommended actions
│   │
│   ├── Evidence bundle (what to include in report)
│   │   ├── Original file (beach_tower.jpg)
│   │   ├── EXIF output (exiftool text)
│   │   ├── pHash value
│   │   ├── Reverse-search links & screenshots (Flickr, travel blog)
│   │   ├── OCR output (out.txt)
│   │   └── Forensics screenshots (ELA, JPEGsnoop)
│   │
│   ├── Findings summary (example)
│   │   ├── Location: Monterey State Beach (lat/long from EXIF and visual match) — HIGH confidence
│   │   ├── Time: 2024-07-22 17:42 local time (EXIF + Flickr timestamp) — MEDIUM-HIGH confidence
│   │   ├── Edits: minor post-processing (Photoshop Express) — no sign of content forgery — MEDIUM confidence
│   │   └── Exposure risk: Public image; no corporate data visible — NO immediate remediation required
│   │
│   └── Suggested next steps
│       ├── If corporate image: rotate any exposed keys, remove image, and conduct full disclosure
│       ├── If personal/public: no action or optional reach-out to uploader if image misuse suspected
│       └── Document the case in Red Team reports for trend analysis
│
└── 10. Lessons learned & follow-up
    │
    ├── Corroboration is everything — prefer multiple independent signals (EXIF + reverse search + visual match)
    ├── Always preserve originals and logs (commands, timestamps)
    ├── Use pHash to detect reposts or manipulated derivatives in future monitoring
    └── If you want, automate the above pipeline (EXIF → OCR → pHash → reverse-search url fetch) for bulk triage
