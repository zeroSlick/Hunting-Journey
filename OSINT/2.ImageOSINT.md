Image OSINT — Detailed Tree-Structured Guide
│
├── 1. What is Image OSINT?
│   │
│   ├── Definition
│   │   └── The practice of extracting actionable intelligence from images and videos in publicly available sources (social media, websites, forums, video platforms).
│   │
│   ├── Goals
│   │   ├── Identify people, places, events, or objects
│   │   ├── Geolocate an image or verify where/when it was taken
│   │   ├── Find image origins and duplicates (provenance)
│   │   └── Extract hidden or textual information (metadata, text, watermarks)
│
├── 2. High-level workflow (ordered)
│   │
│   ├── 1. Triage & preserve
│   │   └── Save original file(s), note source URL, capture context and timestamps (preserve chain of custody for reports).
│   │
│   ├── 2. Metadata & file analysis
│   │   └── Extract EXIF/IPTC/XMP, file hashes, container details.
│   │
│   ├── 3. Reverse image & provenance search
│   │   └── Find duplicates, earlier instances, or the original upload.
│   │
│   ├── 4. Visual content analysis
│   │   └── OCR, object detection, landmark recognition, logo detection, scene classification.
│   │
│   ├── 5. Geolocation & temporal inference
│   │   └── Use landmarks, signs, language, shadows, weather, vegetation, architectural cues, timestamps.
│   │
│   ├── 6. Social context correlation
│   │   └── Map images to user profiles, cross-reference with other posts, videos, or datasets.
│   │
│   └── 7. Reporting & verification
│       └── Build an evidence chain: claims, supporting artifacts, confidence levels, and remediation or action items.
│
├── 3. Data you can extract from an image
│   │
│   ├── File-level
│   │   ├── Filename, format (JPEG/PNG/WEBP), size, container info
│   │   ├── File hashes (MD5/SHA1/SHA256) for deduplication
│   │   └── Compression artifacts (quality, recompression)
│   │
│   ├── Metadata (EXIF/IPTC/XMP)
│   │   ├── Camera make/model, lens, focal length, exposure, timestamp
│   │   ├── GPS coordinates (if present) → direct geolocation
│   │   └── Software used (editors) and creation/modification timestamps
│   │
│   ├── Visual/textual content
│   │   ├── Text via OCR (signs, license plates, documents)
│   │   ├── Faces (presence / count) — note privacy/legal issues
│   │   ├── Logos, brands, clothing, objects
│   │   └── Architectural styles, road signs, vehicle types
│   │
│   └── Derived signals
│       ├── Perceptual hashes (pHash, aHash) for near-duplicate detection
│       ├── Error level analysis (ELA) hints at edits (careful; not definitive)
│       └── Lighting & shadow vectors for time-of-day estimation
│
├── 4. Key techniques (with what they reveal)
│   │
│   ├── Reverse Image Search
│   │   └── Tools: Google Images, TinEye, Yandex, Bing Visual Search → finds duplicates, earlier postings, and source pages.
│   │
│   ├── Metadata extraction
│   │   └── Tools: exiftool, online EXIF viewers → can reveal camera, GPS, software history.
│   │
│   ├── OCR (text extraction)
│   │   └── Tools: Tesseract, Google Vision, OCR.space → reads signs, documents, phone screens, receipts.
│   │
│   ├── Object & scene recognition
│   │   └── Tools/APIs: Google Vision, AWS Rekognition, Azure Vision, open models → identify objects, logos, landmarks, scenes.
│   │
│   ├── Facial analysis (identification is sensitive)
│   │   └── Face detection/embedding tools can cluster same-person images, but identification raises legal/ethical constraints.
│   │
│   ├── Geolocation by visual cues
│   │   └── Landmarks, vegetation, road markings, traffic signs, building styles, language on signs — combine to narrow location.
│   │
│   ├── Shadow & sun position analysis
│   │   └── Estimate time of day and hemisphere/latitude using shadow orientation and sun angle—gives temporal/geographic constraints.
│   │
│   ├── Image forensics
│   │   └── ELA, noise/frequency analysis, JPEG quantization tables, sensor noise patterns (PRNU) to detect manipulation or source camera.
│   │
│   ├── Metadata timeline correlation
│   │   └── Cross-check EXIF timestamps vs page timestamps, sitemap entries, and social post times for consistency.
│   │
│   └── Social graph linking
│       └── Trace image reposts across accounts, find account owners, and build attribution chains.
│
├── 5. Tools & categories (representative, not exhaustive)
│   │
│   ├── Reverse-image engines: Google Images, TinEye, Yandex, Bing
│   ├── EXIF & file analysis: exiftool, Fotoforensics (metadata viewers)
│   ├── OCR: Tesseract, Google Vision API, OCR.space
│   ├── Vision APIs & ML models: Google Vision, AWS Rekognition, Azure Computer Vision, open-source models (Detectron2, YOLO)
│   ├── Forensics: FotoForensics (ELA), JPEGsnoop, Amped Authenticate
│   ├── Mapping & geolocation helpers: Google Maps / Earth, Mapillary, OpenStreetMap, Reverse Geo-visual search communities
│   ├── Hashing / dedupe: pHash, ImageHash libraries
│   └── Aggregation/automation: OSINT frameworks, custom Python scripts using Pillow, OpenCV, requests
│
├── 6. Practical multi-step example (high-level, authorized)
│   │
│   ├── Given an image from a public post:
│   │   ├── Save the original file + source URL + timestamp screenshot
│   │   ├── Extract EXIF → check GPS/camera info
│   │   ├── Reverse-search → find earlier instances or higher-resolution originals
│   │   ├── Run OCR → extract visible text, transliterate if foreign language
│   │   ├── Run object/landmark detection → note any identifiable features
│   │   ├── Correlate with maps & local cues → propose candidate locations
│   │   └── Assign confidence levels and prepare evidence with links/screenshots
│
├── 7. Limitations & pitfalls (what to trust carefully)
│   │
│   ├── EXIF can be stripped or forged — don’t assume authenticity
│   ├── Reverse-search misses uncrawled or newly uploaded images
│   ├── ELA and similar forensic outputs are suggestive, not definitive
│   ├── OCR may misread fonts, low-res text, or non-Latin scripts
│   ├── Visual similarity ≠ identity (look-alikes, stock images)
│   └── Facial ID has legal restrictions and high false-positive risk
│
├── 8. Legal & ethical considerations
│   │
│   ├── Privacy laws (GDPR, etc.) may restrict collection/processing of personal data
│   ├── Face recognition and identification often carry stricter rules — get explicit consent or legal authorization
│   ├── Preserve chain of custody for evidence and avoid publishing sensitive info
│   └── For corporate/Red Team work: always operate within written scope and company policy
│
├── 9. Defensive & hardening advice (for defenders)
│   │
│   ├── Strip EXIF/GPS from images before public upload (automate in web upload pipeline)
│   ├── Avoid embedding internal names, paths, or secrets in images/screenshots
│   ├── Watermark sensitive media (with caution — watermarks themselves can leak info)
│   ├── Rate-limit automated downloads and monitor requests to media endpoints, sitemaps, and image URLs
│   ├── Use low-resolution or cropped previews for public display; keep originals behind auth
│   └── Train staff on OPSEC for images (screenshots: blur/minimize PII)
│
└── 10. Reporting & confidence model
    │
    ├── For each claim produce:
    │   ├── Evidence item (file, URL, timestamp, tool output)
    │   ├── Method used (reverse search, EXIF, OCR, forensic test)
    │   ├── Confidence score (High/Medium/Low) with justification
    │   └── Recommended action (e.g., remove file, rotate keys, no action)
    │
    └── Deliverables:
        ├── Executive summary (what, where, risk)
        ├── Technical appendix (raw outputs, screenshots, queries)
        └── Remediation checklist (what to remove/fix and how to prevent future leaks)
